* How do I approach designing software?

I approach designing software in a whole picture to smallest picture approach. I want to see the whole picture, what should the end product look like? From there, I break it down into smaller components until I get to the point that I can create manageable tasks that build upon each other to create that final picture. This project played into that because we worked in breaking it down into one segment areas that I could further break down. Most of what I can say in terms of new design skills is how it works from the coding side instead of the graphical side. What do I need for the functions and the like to design it are the questions I had to ask. As for how I can apply this in the future, since I want to be a tech writer, this can be useful when describing how these things are done in any future documentation that relates to graphics. 

* How do I approach developing programs?

I approach developing programs in the same way that I approach design and I was able to implement that in there. I look at it in smaller pieces, though this way was more about what code do I need in my development and where can I look for the information that I need. Since we were working in small components each week, I was able to refine as I went along and place the items and so on. Since I prefer to keep everything at a small area, such as this function is for this, and make sure it works, I can include that in the future ,as tech writers do need to have code that people can follow and use. That means it needs to work.

* How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?

The knowledge I gained in this class can help me in the future as it’s almost a guarantee that I’ll be asked to write a technical document, or a programming document, on using code for graphics. There have been times in the past when I was doing some game development, that I had to add code to the system, though it wasn’t through the same methods as here. This will help me better explain and give examples that are going to be useful. In the future for education, anything I need to do that requires graphics, I’ll have a the ability to apply it into the projects that I am working on.
